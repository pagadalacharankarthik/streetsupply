# 🛺 StreetSupply

> A digital platform to streamline raw material procurement for street food vendors by connecting them with trusted local suppliers.

---

## ❗ Problem

In India, **street food vendors** often face challenges sourcing quality raw materials due to:

- Unreliable or inconsistent local suppliers
- Lack of digital systems for tracking orders and inventory
- Middlemen increasing costs and delays
- Zero access to data-driven decision-making

This leads to food waste, profit loss, and operational inefficiencies.

---

## ✅ Solution

**StreetSupply** bridges the gap between **vendors** and **verified local suppliers** by providing:

- A digital vendor dashboard
- Supplier discovery based on product and location
- AI-powered inventory suggestions
- Simple and efficient order placement
- Order tracking and supply history

It enables vendors to manage supplies with confidence, transparency, and speed.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Authentication**  
   Vendors and suppliers sign in to their dashboards using secure authentication.

2. **Vendor Dashboard**  
   Vendors can:
   - View supply history
   - Track live orders
   - Get smart suggestions for re-ordering

3. **Supplier Discovery**  
   - Vendors can search for suppliers by category (e.g., vegetables, oils)
   - Suppliers display location, availability, and contact options

4. **Placing Orders**  
   - Vendors choose products, enter quantity, and place requests
   - Orders are tracked in real-time

5. **AI Inventory Assistance** *(Upcoming)*  
   - Suggests stock replenishment based on vendor behavior
   - Minimizes waste and overstocking
